## How to create an AppleScript service with Automator

Creating an AppleScript service with Automator allows you to integrate custom scripts into your macOS workflow, enabling you to perform actions on files, text, and other system features directly from the Finder or other applications.

### Step 1: Open Automator

1. Open Automator
2. Choose to create a new document

### Step 2: Choose a Type for Your Document

Select "Quick Action" as the type of your document.

### Step 3: Configure the Quick Action

1. At the top of the right pane, configure the Quick Action settings:
   - **Workflow receives current**: Choose "text" from the dropdown menu.
   - **In**: Select "any application" or specify if you want the service to be available in a specific app.
   - Optionally, you can choose an image to represent your Quick Action and assign a color.

### Step 4: Add an AppleScript Action

1. In the search field on the left pane, type "AppleScript" to find the "Run AppleScript" action.
2. Drag the "Run AppleScript" action to the workflow area on the right.

### Step 5: Enter Your AppleScript

1. In the "Run AppleScript" action that you've added to the workflow, you'll see a template script. Replace the template content with the AppleScript code. For the example of converting selected text to Markdown:

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
    set inputText to input as string
    set pandocPath to "/usr/local/bin/pandoc" -- Adjust if your pandoc installation path is different
    -- Pandoc will try to auto-detect the input format
    set markdownText to do shell script pandocPath & " -t markdown <<< " & quoted form of inputText
    return markdownText
end run
```

### Step 6: Save Your Quick Action

1. Go to "File" > "Save" or press `Cmd + S`.
2. Name your Quick Action, such as "Convert to Markdown".
3. Click "Save".

### Step 7: Use Your Quick Action

- To use your new Quick Action, select some text in any application, right-click to open the contextual menu, navigate to the "Services" submenu, and select "Convert to Markdown". The converted Markdown text will replace the selected text or be copied to the clipboard, depending on how you've set up your script.
